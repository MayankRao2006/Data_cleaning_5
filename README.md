Data Cleaning & Visualization Practice

This repository demonstrates my process of cleaning messy data and practicing visualization techniques with Python.
ðŸ‘‰ Note: The values used in the dataset and visualizations are hypothetical and created for practice purposes only.

ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository

messy_data.csv â†’ Original dataset with inconsistencies and missing values.

Cleaning_process.ipynb â†’ Jupyter notebook explaining how I cleaned the messy data step by step.

Cleaned_Data.csv â†’ Final cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

Topic_practise.ipynb â†’ Notebook containing different diagrams and visualizations made using Seaborn.

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Process

In the cleaning notebook, I performed the following steps:

Handled Missing Values

Filled or removed missing entries where necessary.

Fixed Data Types

Converted numeric columns stored as strings into integers/floats.

Standardized date formats where applicable.

Removed Duplicates & Noise

Checked for duplicate rows and dropped them.

Stripped extra spaces and corrected formatting issues.

Renamed Columns for Consistency

Adjusted column names to be consistent and easy to work with in analysis.

ðŸ“Š Visualization Practice

Using the cleaned dataset, I explored different Seaborn plots in Topic_practise.ipynb, such as:

Bar plots

Box plots

Scatter plots

Heatmaps

These diagrams helped me practice exploratory data analysis and understand relationships in the dataset.

ðŸ‘‰ Since the data is hypothetical, the visualizations are purely for learning purposes.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


Install dependencies (recommended to use a virtual environment):

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib jupyter


Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Run the notebooks Cleaning_process.ipynb and Topic_practise.ipynb.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was done for practice â€” to learn:

How to clean messy datasets in Python.

How to visualize data effectively using Seaborn.
